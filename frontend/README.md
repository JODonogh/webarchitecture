# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App on the front end
The directory of the bootstrapped react app was navigated too
Then "code ." was put into the terminal to load the app into VS code. 
On the backend it was started with npm init to give the initial json package
Then npm install express was run in the backend directory

## Dependencies to be installed

Because this is bootstrapped with create-react-app, some dependencies come installed so instructions for installiation will need be included here.

List of dependencies that need to be installed for the frontend:

axios
acorn
npm-run-all

List of dependencies that need to be installed for the backend:

body-parser 
cookie-parser
cors
express
favicon
mongoose
morgan
multer
pug
serve-favicon
uuid

These can be installed by writing into the terminal "npm install" and the name of the dependency afterwards, e.g: "npm install multer"

### `npm start`

You must change the directory in the terminal to navigate to the directory frontend and type npm start
The same must be done for backend directory
